General lockfree Monte Carlo Tree Search implementation in Java

### Results

Result from the included n x n x k TicTacToe game on an `i7 5820k`

![](benchmark.png)

The baseline player thinks 400 iterations vs a singlethreaded player that thinks n * 400 iterations and a multithreaded player that thinks 400 iterations on each thread.

```java -cp classes:test-classes mcts.BenchmarkMcts 8 6 200 400```
