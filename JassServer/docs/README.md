### Hackathon rules (01.02.2017)

* All card colors and play modes are counted equally (e.g. Obeabe is not multiplied by 3)
* A session finishes when 2500 points are reached by one team
* You start and connect two bots which will then play together and must not communicate with each other (To not complicate things we will just trust you that your bots won't do this)
* Each team plays against every other team once (Round-robin tournament), the team with the most session victories, wins the hackathon and will be remembered forever
* Bots may use 0.5s max per turn. Otherwise they will lose the current game but will be able to play the next game again.
